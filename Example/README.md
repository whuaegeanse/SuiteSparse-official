An example of how to use the SuiteSparse `Find*.cmake` files in cmake
to build a library that depends on SuiteSparse libraries.

    build                   where the 'my' package is built

The 'my' library relies on the following SuiteSparse libraries, each of which
has a cmake module to use in `find_package` that is installed alongside the
compiled libraries (/usr/local/lib/cmake/SuiteSparse) `AMD`, `BTF`, `CAMD`,
`CCOLAMD`, `CHOLMOD`, `COLAMD`, `CXSparse`, `GPUQREngine`, `GraphBLAS`, `KLU`,
`KLU_CHOLMOD`, `LAGraph`, `LDL`, `Mongoose`, `RBio`, `SPEX`, `SPQR`,
`SPQR_CUDA`, `SuiteSparse_GPURuntime`, `SuiteSparse_config`, and `UMFPACK`.

In addition, the 'my' package relies on the following external libraries:
`BLAS`, `LAPACK`, `OpenMP`, `GMP`, and `MPFR`.

To compile the `my` package and run a demo program:

    On Linux or Mac:

        make
        make demos
        sudo make install

    On Windows: load Example/CMakeLists.txt into MS Visual Studio

To remove all compiled files and folders, delete the contents of Example/build
(but keep Example/build/.gitignore):

        make clean

See the instructions in CMakeLists.txt for additional instructions (in
particular, if SuiteSparse is not found).
